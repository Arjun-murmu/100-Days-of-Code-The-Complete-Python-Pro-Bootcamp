  <h1>Style Me in Green</h1>
  <h2>Used the external CSS</h2>
  <h3> External CSS is used to apply styling to web pages,
     particularly when a consistent design needs to be maintained across multiple HTML documents within a website.
      This approach involves creating a separate .
      css file that contains all the style rules, 
      which is then linked to one or more HTML files. </h3>
